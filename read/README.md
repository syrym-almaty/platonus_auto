3. **Admission Rules for Master's and PhD Programs at MIIT (R-42 I-07)**. [Link](https://iitu.edu.kz/documents/3165/Правила_приема_на_обучение_в_магистратуре_i_PhD_докторантуре_2024г..pdf)
4. **Instructional Seminars and Guidelines** on admission issues for higher and postgraduate education programs in 2024, as well as other normative legal acts of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan (MNVO RK).

In accordance with the legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan, admission requirements for domestic and international students may differ. The main points are reflected on the university's website: [MIIT Admissions](https://iitu.edu.kz/ru/articles/ac/).

#### Key Differences:

1. **According to the Standard Admission Rules** approved by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan Order No. 600 dated October 31, 2018, the admission of foreign citizens under the allocated quota based on educational grants to international higher educational institutions (OVPO) established through interstate agreements is carried out by the OVPO independently. Admission of foreign citizens for paid studies in OVPO is conducted based on interviews conducted by the OVPO admissions committees throughout the calendar year. Enrollment of foreign citizens is carried out in accordance with the academic calendar five (5) days before the start of the next academic period. In contrast, enrollment of Kazakhstani students into OVPO as beneficiaries of the republican budget, local budget, or on a paid basis is conducted by OVPO admissions committees from June 20 to August 25 of the calendar year.
   
2. **Unified National Testing (ENT):** Mandatory for Kazakhstani students; not required for international students.

3. **Procedure for Recognizing Previous Education:**
   - According to the Standard Admission Rules approved by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan Order No. 600 dated October 31, 2018, foreign students are required to have their education documents issued by foreign educational institutions recognized in Kazakhstan according to the established legislative procedures after enrollment, within the first academic period of study.

4. **According to the Admission Rules for Bachelor's Programs at MIIT (R-41 I-06):**
   - After enrollment, foreign students must contact the Department of International Cooperation and Academic Mobility to obtain temporary registration/visa (depending on the country of arrival).

#### Admission Process:

During the admission phase, Admissions Committee staff analyze documents to ensure that formal requirements meet the necessary competencies for the studied program. For example, compliance with profile subjects of the Unified National Testing (ENT) as specified in the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan Order No. 204 dated May 2, 2017. For the specified educational programs, mathematics and informatics are considered profile subjects according to the Methodological Recommendations for Compliance of Related Groups of Higher Education Programs and Specialties of Technical and Professional, Post-secondary Education approved by the Ministry of Education and Science of Kazakhstan Order No. 134 dated April 1, 2019.

- **According to the Rules for Determining the Level of English Language Proficiency, Conducting Additional Exams, and Interviews for Applicants to Bachelor's Programs at JSC "International University of Information Technologies" for the 2024-2025 Academic Year (R-40):**
  - The admission process includes testing and interviews on specialized subjects for applicants based on TIPO (pre-university preparation), which also helps determine how well applicants meet the necessary competencies.
  
During enrollment, the analysis of the initial level of students' knowledge and skills, reflected in ENT scores, shows that applicants in the "Information Technologies" educational group (maximum score in the general competition – 129 points, minimum – 82 points) demonstrate a high level of competencies. This confirms that the admission requirements were correctly formulated and correspond to the program's target profiles.

During the study phase, responsible individuals (advisors, Registrar Office, dean's offices) analyze students' academic performance to monitor the achievement of targeted competency profiles and the effectiveness of established requirements, which is reflected in reports. Upon completion of interim assessments, a report is formed on all assigned grades by educational program groups (OP), courses, faculties, and the university.

If students who meet admission requirements consistently show progress in mastering academic disciplines, it indicates that such requirements provide the necessary basic level for successful study and development of professional competencies.

**For example:**

- **Winter Interim Assessment Results for the 2023-2024 Academic Year:**
  - Overall university student grades: 49% received grades between 90-100% (A+/A), 36% received grades between 75-89% (B+/B), 10% received grades between 50-74% (C+/C), 7.6% received grades between 50-59% (D+/D), and 12.2% failed (F).

- **Spring Interim Assessment Results for the 2023-2024 Academic Year:**
  - 31% received grades between 90-100% (A/A-), 38% received grades between 75-89% (B+/B), 21% received grades between 50-74% (C+/C), 7% received grades between 50-59% (D+/D), and 4% failed (F).

These data indicate that, on average, 84% of the student contingent at the university successfully master disciplines with grades above C-.

Additionally, another indicator is the graduation rate. In 2023, the successful completion rate was 74.5% (admissions to bachelor's in 2019 – 1,227 students; graduates – 956). In 2024, this rate was 76.7% (admissions in 2020 – 1,393 students; graduates – 1,068). High graduation rates indicate that the initial requirements effectively selected students capable of achieving the educational program's goals.

Due to dissatisfaction among teachers with the English language proficiency of applicants, preparatory English courses were developed and offered at the university. During the summer period, these courses were attended by 413 applicants in 2023 and 599 in 2024.

In cases of significant differences in students' preparation levels, faculty members may propose dividing groups based on material mastery levels, allowing for more effective teaching of those needing additional preparation. For example, the Language Department annually divides students into groups for subjects such as English, Kazakh, and Russian.

Teachers can directly inform students if their preparation does not meet program requirements and that they need to exert more effort to successfully master the material. Faculty compensate for low initial preparation levels by offering additional free courses on the Coursera platform or in-depth study of subjects for students with higher initial levels. For instance, in 2023, students Sultanova Nazerke (IS) completed 127 courses, Akaidar Abzal (IS) completed 66 courses, and Autov Rustam (KB) completed 23 courses, among others.

**Evaluation of Admission Rules:**

The assessment of whether the university's admission rules ensure sufficient preliminary knowledge for successful study is based on the analysis of students' performance in the first year. If most students face difficulties mastering basic courses, it may indicate insufficient preliminary preparation, particularly:

- **Based on the analysis of student attrition dynamics in the first year:**
  - By the end of the 2022-2023 academic year, 55 first-year students were expelled due to poor performance, accounting for 4.4% of the total first-year contingent.
  - In the 2023-2024 academic year, this figure was 30 students, accounting for 2.1% of the first-year contingent.

This indicates that the admission rules ensure a sufficient level of applicant preparation.

- **Statistical data on the number of students receiving low grades or retaking subjects** also serve as indicators of the quality of preliminary preparation. For example, in the summer semester of the 2022-2023 academic year, 277 first-year students participated, constituting 22% of the total first-year contingent. In the 2023-2024 academic year, 304 students participated, also constituting 22% of the first-year contingent.

- **Employment Rates of Graduates:**
  According to data from the National Placement Center "Atameken," in 2023, employment rates for educational programs were as follows:
  - **6B06106 Computer Systems and Software Engineering:** 94%
  - **6B06110 Software Engineering:** 94%
  - **7M06101 Software Engineering:** 100%
  - **7M06110 Computer Systems and Software Engineering:** 100%
  - **8D06102 Computer and Software Engineering:** 100%

These high employment rates indicate the high qualification of graduates, indirectly confirming the correctness of established admission requirements.
